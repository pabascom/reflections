When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all
your work local?

Whenever you're working on more than one computer, or with more than one
team member. Though it's honestly a good idea to use a remote repository
for *all* of your projects, just so you have the code in two locations.
It's more secure that way.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having
Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

In order to maintain control over your own work. You might not have any
control over the contents of a public, or even a shared, repository;
other team members are likely to be committing their own work in their
own time. By pulling manually, you make sure that you always know when
the code on your computer--the code that you're working on, and working
with--changes.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would
you use one instead of another?

Branches represent different lines of work within the same project. They
should be used to introduce new features, or work on new code in a safe
environment.

Clones represent instances of an existing repository, including the
entire commit history and all branches of that repository. They should
be used when you want to resume work on an existing project in a new
location or on a new computer.

Forks represent the creation of a new repository with the initial
content of an existing repository. They represent an entirely new
repository, causally disconnected from their source, and should be
used when you want to make your own version of someone else's
project, or when you want to make a substantially different version
of your own work (which you do not intend to merge back into the
primary flow).
