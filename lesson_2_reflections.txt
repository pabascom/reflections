What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

Initializing a repository creates the .git folder and creates all the 
files you need to start tracking your project. It's necessary to set up
git; you can't track your files without installing the file tracker
first.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the
repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area acts as a medium in between the working directory and
the repository. It allows you to see and evaluate the changes in any
given commit before you--well, commit it. This is useful because it
gives you a chance to reflect on and change what you're committing
before it's accomplished. I actually decided to modify my last commit
while it was in the staging area; if there weren't a staging area, it
would have been too late. Just having that extra step helps you to stop
and think.

Besides, I guess without the staging area, it would be impossible to
store the current state of your working directory in multiple commits.
You would have to store all of it, or none of it.

How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per
logical change?

Well, files in the staging area can easily be compared to alternate
versions in either the working directory or the repository with git
diff. This makes it really easy to see what, exactly, will be changed
with each commit, so you can make sure everything you want (and nothing
you don't) makes it in.
